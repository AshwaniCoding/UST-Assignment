# UST Assignments

This repository contains a Command-Line Interface (CLI) based Library Management System developed as part of the UST assignment. The system automates key library functions such as book management, issuing and returning books, calculating fines, and generating reports. It's designed to provide a streamlined and efficient way to manage library operations using simple command-line inputs.
